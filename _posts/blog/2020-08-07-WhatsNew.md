I haven't updated the site for quite a while, so I suppose now is a good time to update.
For programming I've fooled around with some csound score generating files, a simple game game based on mathematical graphs and a bunch of graphical programs in plain C outputting ppm files.
For mathematics I've been working through Understanding Analysis by Abbott, Elementary Number Theory by Dudley. 
Last semester I worked through Logics by Nolt, one of those Schaums books on Set Theory and a good portion of Discrete Mathematics and its Applications by Rosen.
I'd really like to dig more into some Mathematical Logic, Abstract Algebra, Formal Language Theory, Formal Semantics, Combinatorics, Topology and other Math/CS/Logic areas.
My plate is already pretty full so those are all long term goals
