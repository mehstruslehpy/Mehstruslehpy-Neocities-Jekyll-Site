title: Who Am I?
---

My username on various websites is mehstruslehpy. I have been studying computer science formally for about two years. I first became interested in programming from working IT and getting an opportunity to play with the programming language Forth and the Bash Scripting language on various \*nix systems. Most of my experience programming is with C++ although I can usually figure out enough to be productive with the following: Python, Lisp, Javascript, Bash, and C. I feel pretty confident that given enough time I could learn most programming languages.

Currently I do most of my computing on a Linux laptop, I really enjoy using the text editor Vim alongside Tmux and Bash, my current window manager is Dwm. I also enjoy using Windows and previously did tech support work on old Solaris, Windows and IRIX workstations. Someday I would like to write my own operating system for my own personal use.  

I am passionate about ethical software, education, open source software, music, mathematics and art though I do not claim to be an expert in any of those things. When I am not programming or studying you can find me browsing the internet, reading a new book or tinkering around with my computer.
