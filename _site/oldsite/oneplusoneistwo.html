    <h1>A Silly and Probably Incorrect Proof For 1+1=2: </h1>
    <p>
      Several months ago I was reading a book called Introduction To Logic by Harry Gensler with the intent of teaching myself some new things about logic 
      when I came across the following passage:
    </p>
    <img src="TheContext.jpg" alt="it sounded like a fun exercise" style="width:900px;height:500px">
    <p>
      I decided this sounded fun so I took a crack at it using the system shown in the book. Each step in the proof is numbered, 
      the proofs are structured similar to a two column proof, the justification for each derivation is inside the curly braces to the right, 
      assumptions that lead to contradictions are blocked off with a line and the following statement uses the source of contradiction as its reasoning.
      
    </p>
    <img src="ProofPg1.jpg" alt="Please ignore those extraneous therefore's in the premises.." style="width:750px;height:750px">
    <img src="ProofPg2.jpg" alt="did I mention that I am not a professional?" style="width:750px;height:750px">
    <img src="ProofPg3.jpg" alt="well there you have it, clear as day." style="width:750px;height:750px">
    <p>
      The exercise was very entertaining, this was probably my third attempt the previous ones ending in headaches and failure. 
      There are still errors in this one, 
      for example I accidently placed âˆ´ symbols in front of my premises at the start, 
      and I am reasonably sure my closing parentheses are not all perfectly matched.
    </p>
    <p>
      In retrospect I feel like I gained a deeper understanding of how hard it can be to sift through certain topics in a logical system. 
      Some problems in certain contexts can be very elegant to state and work out while others can devolve into total nightmares.
    </p>
    <p>Fill me in if you catch any errors in my proof and I will post your corrections on this page!</p>
