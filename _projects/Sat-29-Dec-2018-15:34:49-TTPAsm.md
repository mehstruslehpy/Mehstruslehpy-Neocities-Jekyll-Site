I created the TTPAsm because the original assembler for the TTP was written as a google docs spreadsheet. This works well for the purpose of being cross platform and easily accesible to the class, but it is not the greatest for scripting purposes or for using other general purpose text processing utilities like m4. I was also very interested in writing my own assembler tool for the experience of having written one.
